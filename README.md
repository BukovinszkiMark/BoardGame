# BoardGame
This is a simple board game played locally by 2 players.

# Rules:
A player has to make one of these two moves in their turn:
- Place a new piece to one of the neighboring 8 squares of one of their pieces.
- Move one of their pieces 2 squares horizontally or vertically.

If a player cannot make one of these moves, then the game is over.

After every move, any enemy pieces in the neighboring 8 squares of the square where a piece was moved to
or placed at will become the current player's piece.


# Scoring:
When a game is over each piece a player owns on the board is worth 1 point.
Additionally, all empty squares are added as 1 point for the last player able to make a move.
